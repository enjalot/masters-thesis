\section{Introduction to the Framework}

There are many aspects to particle systems which will be common to different
simulations, namely the locations of each particle in some space as well as the
notion of displaying them in some way. In order to create an extensible tool we
designed an object oriented software framework for general particle systems.
The primary motivation for this is to avoid duplicating work when creating
different simulations.
