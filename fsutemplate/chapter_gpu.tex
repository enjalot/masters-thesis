\subsection{float4}
The OpenCL 1.0 specification defines the $float4$ type as a vector of four
floating point numbers. Since our simulation is designed to be 3 dimensional it
is the most convenient data type for storing arrays of coordinates. The OpenCL
1.1 standard does define a $float3$ type, but as of this writing the 1.0
standard is still the most widely available implementation so we use $float4$
for backwards compatibility. We have also found it convenient to package many
variables into a single array for use on the GPU, and we are able to utilize
the unused components of 3 dimensional vectors for storing some scalar values.
