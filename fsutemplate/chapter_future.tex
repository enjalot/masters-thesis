\chapter{Future Work}

\section{Optimization}
Improved neighbor search following Steve's method (Z indexing)


More efficient sort


triangle collisions calculated using an efficient data structure rather than brute force


\section{Rendering}
real-time rendering of a surface


\section{Blender}
* improved integration with blender, making a game engine particle class and
eventually extend existing particles


Interaction with rigid bodies using Bullet physics


Modifiers for various emitters


\section{SPH}
Improvements to SPH method including surface tension, smoothing of field variables


semi-analytic collision calculations \cite{Manenti2011} \cite{Harada2007}

Adding granular materials


Unifying with particle based solid methods to implement melting and freezing states.


Adaptive methods for improved performance
